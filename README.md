# ðŸŽƒ Thanksgiving Pumpkin Carving ðŸŽƒ

#### ðŸ“‹ Description:

This **Pumpkin Carving Graphic** is a fun, holiday themed visual that I have made using extensions in java such as JFrame, Graphics, and Color.

---

### âœ¨ File Desription:
**GraphicsDriver** -  This class extends JFrame and serves as the main window for the application. It sets up the frame, its size, and the default closing operation. It then adds the Pumpkin object to the frame's content pane.

**Pumpkin** - This class extends Canvas and is responsible for drawing the pumpkin and its carved features. The paint method, which is automatically invoked when the component needs to be drawn, is overridden to draw the ground, the pumpkin itself, and the carved elements.

---

### This Current Implementation Includes:
-A twilight-colored background.

-A string displaying "SANJANA's Carved Pumpkin!".

-Methods to draw the ground and the pumpkin.
