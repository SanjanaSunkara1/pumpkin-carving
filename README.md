# Graphics Driver

This is a simple Java Swing application that demonstrates basic graphics drawing.

## Description

This project utilizes the Java Swing library to create a window (`JFrame`) and display a custom graphical component (`Pumpkin`) on it. The `Pumpkin` class, which extends `Canvas`, is responsible for drawing a simple shape, though the provided code snippet only draws a string with "***". The background of the window is set to a twilight color (RGB: 23, 29, 32).

## Requirements

*   Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

## How to Compile and Run

1.  **Save the code:** Save the provided code as two separate files: `GraphicsDriver.java` and `Pumpkin.java`.
2.  **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the files, and compile the Java code using the following command:
    ```bash
    javac GraphicsDriver.java Pumpkin.java
    ```
3.  **Run:** Execute the compiled program using the following command:
    ```bash
    java GraphicsDriver
    ```
    This will launch a window with the title "Graphics Driver" displaying the output of the `Pumpkin` class.

## Project Structure

*   `GraphicsDriver.java`: The main class that sets up the `JFrame` and adds the `Pumpkin` canvas.
*   `Pumpkin.java`: The class responsible for the custom graphics drawing. It extends `Canvas` and overrides the `paint` method.

## Future Enhancements

*   Implement the drawing of an actual pumpkin within the `Pumpkin` class.
*   Add more interactive elements to the GUI.
*   Explore different Swing components and layouts to enhance the application's complexity.
