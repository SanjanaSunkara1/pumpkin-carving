# 🎃 Thanksgiving Pumpkin Carving 🎃

#### 📋 Description:

This **Pumpkin Carving Graphic** is a fun, holiday themed visual that I have made using extensions in java such as JFrame, Graphics, Color Using just your keyboard, you line up shots by entering an **angle (1–90°)** and **power (1–30)** — then watch your shot fly across an ASCII basketball court with realistic projectile motion physics.

Each shot is unique; the hoop 🏀 moves to a new random location after every attempt, so you’ll need to adjust your aim and power each time. You’ve got **10 seconds per input** and **5 total shots**, so get ready to beat the buzzer! ⏱️

Score **3 or more baskets**, and you’ll hear a celebratory sound and see a trophy message. 🎉
